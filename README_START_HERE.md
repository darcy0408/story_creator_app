## 📱 ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS

### Q1: "How do I test it?"
✅ **Answer**: Just run the 3 steps above! The app will open in Chrome.

### Q2: "Is there a way to get parents to easily integrate it to their AI if they are not tech savvy?"
✅ **Answer**: YES! I created **PARENT_SIMPLE_SETUP.md** with:

**For Parents - ONE-TAP SETUP:**
1. App automatically detects if their phone has built-in AI (Pixel 8+, iPhone 15 Pro+)
2. Shows a simple popup: "Use your phone's AI for FREE stories?"
3. They tap "YES"
4. Done! Stories are now FREE forever!

**What they see:**
```
